# Lessons Learned

Lessons are stored here and **used by the Earned Schedule Excellence Project Controls System** to improve future proposals (Decision Matrix options, what-if scenarios, re-sequencing, cost/risk mitigations). Agents read this file when proposing options and cite or apply relevant lessons.

## Entry format

For each lesson, include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Date** | Date or phase/milestone (e.g. 2025-02-01 or "Block B IST") |
| **Event/context** | What triggered the lesson (e.g. "Generator #4 delay, Block B") |
| **What happened** | Option(s) presented, chosen, or rejected (e.g. "Option A chosen: double-shift; Option B rejected: re-route crew") |
| **Outcome** | Result when known (e.g. "Recovered 5 days; cost +$45k") |
| **Lesson** | What we learned (e.g. "Double-shift effective for L2 testing; re-route caused resource conflict") |
| **Recommendation for future** | How to use this next time (e.g. "Prefer double-shift over cross-block re-route for single-block delay") |

## When to add entries

- After **Level 3 (RCA)** and option selection (Approve Option A/B)
- After **Request Alternate** (why options were declined; what would have been preferred)
- After **phase or milestone** closeout (what worked / didn’t; how to improve)
- After **rework** on an approved option (feeds Historical_Accuracy and Trust Score)

## Lessons (add below)

*Example:*

### LL-001
- **Date**: 2025-02-01
- **Event/context**: Generator #4 (Block B) delay, 10 days
- **What happened**: Option A (double-shift L2 testing) chosen; Option B (re-route West Wing crew) rejected
- **Outcome**: Recovered 5 days; cost +$45k
- **Lesson**: Double-shift effective for L2 testing; re-route was seen as resource conflict risk
- **Recommendation for future**: Prefer double-shift over cross-block re-route for single-block delay
